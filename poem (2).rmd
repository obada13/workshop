## First Verse 

<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->  

"OU are old, Father William," the young man said,

"And your hair has become very white;

And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- 

Do you think, at your age, it is right?" 

 
"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,

## Second Verse

<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Out through the fields and the woods  

And over the walls I have wended;  
   
I have climbed the hills of view  

And looked at the world, and descended;  
   
I have come by the highway home,
  
  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea, 

Shining with all his might: 

He did his very best to make  

The billows smooth and bright-- 

And this was odd, because it was 

The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily, 

Because she thought the sun

Had got no business to be there  

After the day was done-- 

"It's very rude of him," she said, 

"To come and spoil the fun!" 

  
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->  

The city had withdrawn into itself   

And left at last the country to the country;  

When between whirls of snow not come to lie    

And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove   

A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,    

Yet did in country fashion in that there    

He sat and waited till he drew us out,    

A-buttoning coats, to ask him who he was.   

He proved to be the city come again   

To look for something it had left behind   

And could not do without and keep its Christmas.  

He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;  

My woodsâ€”the young fir balsams like a place   

Where houses all are churches and have spires.  

I hadn't thought of them as Christmas trees.    

I doubt if I was tempted for a moment    

To sell them off their feet to go in cars    

And leave the slope behind the house all bare,   

Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.    

I'd hate to have them know it if I was.    

Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees, except
